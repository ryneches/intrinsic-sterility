Thank you for your submission to PeerJ. I am writing to inform you that in my
opinion as the Academic Editor for your article, your manuscript "On the
intrinsic sterility of 3D printing" (#2014:10:2804:0:0:REVIEW) requires some
minor revisions before we could accept it for publication.

The comments supplied by the reviewers on this revision are pasted below. My
comments are as follows:

Editor's comments
=================

All reviewer comments are pertinent. In particular could the authors address
the generality of the approach to 3D printing (FDM or others?) and materials
(PLA? others? ). Also can they comment on how melt temperatures likely
influence the sterility?

If you are willing to undertake these changes, please submit your revised
manuscript (with any rebuttal information*) to the journal within 45 days.

* Resubmission checklist:

When resubmitting, in addition to any revised files (e.g. a clean manuscript
version, figures, tables, which you will add to the "Primary Files" upload
section), please also provide the following two items:

A rebuttal Letter: A single document where you address all the Editor and
reviewers' suggestions or requirements, point-by-point.

A 'Tracked Changes' version of your manuscript: A document that shows the
tracking of the revisions made to the manuscript. You can also choose to
simply highlight or mark in bold the changes if you prefer. Accepted formats
for the rebuttal letter and tracked changes document are: docx (preferred),
doc, or PDF.

As you previously uploaded a single manuscript file for your initial
submission you will need to upload any primary high resolution image and table
files separately if you have not already done so.

Basic reporting

In this manuscript, entitled "On the intrinsic sterility of 3D printing" by
Neches et al., the authors investigate the ability of melt extrusion 3D
printing to, by its high thermal window for extrusion of most thermoplastics,
intrinsically sterilize extruded material. The authors do a good job
describing the goals of the work and show support of their hypothesis that
extruded PLA filament is more sterile than non-extruded filament. Sequencing
of resulting colonies was a great idea.

Nevertheless, the work could be improved in several ways:

1) a simple diagram (perhaps as figure 1a) explaining melt extrusion would
help to indicate where heating and sterilization as observed is happening. The
authors further reference high pressures in the nozzle, but provide no
quantitative measure or characterization.

2) the window of 10-120 s for FDM is quite large. The authors should indicate
sterilization times as a function of melt extrusion rate, since faster rates
of extrusion may not heat the plastic for sufficient time to lead to full
sterility, according to their model of sterilization through extrusion.

3) the authors equate consumer-grade FDM PLA plastic with medical grade
polylactic acid. However, the authors do not provide evidence of the ease with
which their commercial PLA can be degraded, and PLA filament manufacturers do
not indicate what their exact formulation (such as MW or other polymeric
additives) or non-polymeric additives (including coloring) are added to the
filaments. The authors should carefully distinguish FDM PLA filament from
medical grade polylactic acid or provide sufficient characterization of said
PLA filament to prove equivalence. In particular, the colorings chosen or
degradation products may lead to cytotoxicity.

4) Figure 3 needs a scale bar. Further, the referenced data of "cell size,
morphology, and confluency" did not appear to be presented anywhere. Further,
the definition of "intermediate UV" and indeed even "UV treated" did not
appear to be quantified. The authors need to provide the light wavelength used
and an estimate or quantitation of the fluence (typically given as mW/cm2) and
time scale utilized for these sterilization procedures to allow replication by
others.

5) There are many kinds of "3D printing" as referenced by the overly broad
title, but the authors only investigate FDM. Thus, the title should be
narrowed to fit the manuscript, perhaps as: "On the intrinsic sterility of
melt-extrusion 3D printing".

Overall this is an interesting and important work and would be suitable for
publication if these concerns can be sufficiently addressed.

Basic reporting

the paper is well written and well organized. the methods adopted to perform
the experiments are clear and well described and the results are clearly
discussed.

Experimental design

the experimental designed is well described, i would suggest to perform other
experiments changing the topology of FDM realized scaffold, because the
topology of cylinder scaffold used is simple, it must be realised scaffolds
with more complex topology where the presence of interconnected struts can
alter the sterility of structure.

Validity of the findings

the results are really interesting but i'm not sure if the scaffold topology
is more complex these findings will be valide. More experiments increasing the
3D topology should be performed.

Reviewer 3 (David Cuartielles)
==============================

Basic reporting

- The submission follows PeerJ's policies
- The article is written in English, it is clear but it has a couple (about 5) 
  misspelling errors that should be corrected
- The article provides sufficient background
- The structure is fine
- Figures are relevant to the contents
- The text is self-contained and results are VERY relevant to the hypothesis

Experimental design

- In my understanding the research here presented is original
- The research question is clear
- The investigation is the result of the collaboration of several laboratories
- Methods can be replicated by other investigators, though I am missing 
  information about the firmware versions of the machines used in to print the
  different parts
- The ethical committee from one of the participating universities is mentioned 
  regarding the use of animals in the tests

Validity of the findings

- The data includes a series of control experiments, seems to be consistent
  and replicable
- I am not familiar with the field the authors work with (sterile lab-ware)
  or the tests they have used to evaluate how sterile their self-made tools
  are. I cannot evaluate this aspect
- The conclusions are properly stated and linked to the research question. In
  my opinion, the authors are modest about the possibilities this experiments
  are offering

Comments for the author

Please add information about:
- (minor changes) Firmware used in the machines where you printed the parts, 
  specially if there were any alterations from the original ones
- (minor changes) External ways to assess the machines are working according
  to the information they show in their displays like using an IR temperature
  gun to confirm the temperature on the extruder, etc. It is important to know
  how far you went in making sure the machines were working as expected
- (optional) It would be great if you added some more information about your
  future plans in this field. I would love to see a large-size experiment where
  you asked people to create your normalized test (I consider the cylinder is a
  normalized test) and send it for testing alongside a description of the
  machine they are using
