Beef extractives and starch are not added. Activated charcoal (Norit A or Norit SG) is included at 0.20\% (wt/vol). Comparison of charcoal-yeast extract and F-G agars showed that a greater number of colony-forming units of L. pneumophila was recovered from a standardized tissue inoculum on charcoal-yeast extract agar (4.35 x 10(6) colony-forming units) than on F-G agar (4.85 x 10(4) colony-forming units). Macroscopic colonies of L. pneumophila were visible on the new medium within 3 days, whereas 4 days of growth was required on F-G agar.}},

We substituted 0.1\% sodium taurocholate for the 2.5\% egg yolk in CCFA and compared the growth of 15 isolates of C. difficile on the resulting medium with growth on conventional CCFA. The taurocholate-containing medium (TCCFA) quantitatively recovered vegetative forms of C. difficile in the same numbers as CCFA medium. Recovery of spores was a mean 1.7 log(10) higher on TCCFA than on CCFA. Thirty-six of 60 patient stool specimens growing C. difficile gave a heavier growth on TCCFA than on CCFA, and 9 failed to yield C. difficile on CCFA. TCCFA detected spores of 75 colony-forming units per ml from artificially inoculated fecal specimens when conventional stool culturing techniques were used. Fluorescence of colonies of C. difficile was more intense on TCCFA than on CCFA. TCCFA was simpler to prepare and, overall, was more sensitive than CCFA.}},

Spores are resistant to heat, radiation, chemicals, and antibiotics, making a contaminated environment difficult to clean. To cause disease, however, spores must germinate and grow out as vegetative cells. The germination of C. difficile spores has not been examined in detail. In an effort to understand the germination of C. difficile spores, we characterized the response of C. difficile spores to bile. We found that cholate derivatives and the amino acid glycine act as cogerminants. Deoxycholate, a metabolite of cholate produced by the normal intestinal flora, also induced germination of C. difficile spores but prevented the growth of vegetative C. difficile. A model of resistance to C. difficile colonization mediated by the normal bacterial flora is proposed.}},

@article{seaweed_human_gut,
    abstract = {{Humans host an intestinal population of microbes--collectively
 referred to as the gut microbiome--which encode the carbohydrate active enzymes, or CAZymes, that are absent from the human genome. These CAZymes help to extract energy from recalcitrant polysaccharides. The question then arises as to if and how the microbiome adapts to new carbohydrate sources when modern humans change eating habits. Recent metagenome analysis of microbiomes from healthy American, Japanese, and Spanish populations identified putative CAZymes obtained by horizontal gene transfer from marine bacteria, which suggested that human gut bacteria evolved to degrade algal carbohydrates-for example, consumed in form of sushi. We approached this hypothesis by studying such a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) obtained by horizontal gene transfer by the gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. Transcriptomic and growth experiments revealed that the PUL responds to the polysaccharide porphyran from red algae, enabling growth on this carbohydrate but not related substrates like agarose and carrageenan. The X-ray crystallographic and biochemical analysis of two proteins encoded by this PUL, BACPLE\_01689 and BACPLE\_01693, showed that they are β-porphyranases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 16 and 86, respectively. The product complex of the GH86 at 1.3 \AA{} resolution highlights the molecular details of porphyran hydrolysis by this new porphyranase. Combined, these data establish experimental support for the argument that CAZymes and associated genes obtained from extrinsic microbes add new catabolic functions to the human gut microbiome.}},

A collection of bacterial mutants defective for growth in macrophages were isolated, and the intracellular fate of each mutant strain was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. To measure intracellular replication, bacteria inside macrophages were stained with the DNA dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Evasion of the endocytic pathway was quantified by immunofluorescence localization of lp120 [correction of IgpI20] (LAMP-1), a membrane protein of late endosomes and lysosomes, or by measuring colocalization of bacteria with a fluorescent tracer, Texas red-ovalbumin, preloaded into lysosomes. Replication vacuoles were quantified by immunofluorescence localization of BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum protein. By these approaches, four phenotypic groups of mutants were classified. One class formed replication vacuoles less efficiently than the wild type did; another formed replication vacuoles, but replication was abortive; in another class, most phagosomes containing bacteria acquired markers of the endocytic pathway but a minority formed replication vacuoles and the bacteria replicated; finally, a fourth class, the one most defective for intracellular growth, occupied vacuoles that acquired markers of the endocytic pathway.}},

As a control, common hospital sterilization was performed. In all cases, the molecular weight decreased after sterilization. A short time high-temperature sterilization led to less molecular weight decrease than a low sterilization temperature cycle with a longer sterilization time. Regular hospital sterilization significantly reduced the elongation at break and also resulted in a decrease of 35\% in tensile strength. The program causing minimal damage to the material properties was studied in detail. This program, with a sterilization period of 60 s and 129 degrees C, was effective for PLLA sterilization and also looks very promising for sterilization of other thermo- and moisture-labile polymers.}},

Details of the synthesis of PGA and PLA polymers from their cyclic diesters are described, as well as a series of glycolide/lactide copolymers. The reactions were followed by time sampling techniques. The resulting samples were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (g.p.c.), differential scanning calorimetry (d.s.c.), thermogravimetric analysis (t.g.a.) and 220 MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (n.m.r.). Details of these analytical technicques are given. The respective reactivity ratios of glycolide and lactide are elucidated. The effect of 60Co γ radiation on the molecular properties of PGA is also shown.}},

    abstract = {{Implantable polylactic/glycolic acid matrix systems have successfully provided the sustained release of naltrexone to mice for periods of up to 200 days. In vitro and in vivo release rates have been determined by measuring chemical concentrations in pH 7 buffer solution and urine, respectively, and in vivo efficacy has been measured by direct challenge with morphine (Dewey-Harris mouse tail-flick test). Dosage forms of small inplantable cylinders, 1/16 inch diameter, (25 mg/rod, one rod/mouse) containing 33 per cent by weight naltrexone pamoate in 90 L(+)/10 polylactic/glycolic acid have sustained the delivery of chemical for 200 days. Delivery of chemical from dosage forms of 1/16 inch diameter spherical beads (3 mg/bead, 3 beads/mouse) containing 33 per cent by weight naltrexone base in 90 L(+)/10 polylactic/glycolic acid was sustained for 60 days. Earlier a similar bead type dosage form of 75 L(+)/25 polylactic/glycolic acid containing 50 per cent by weight naltrexone base and coated with the pure polymer provided controlled release for 25 days. Polymerization conditions which incorporate the use of pharmacologically suitable catalysts and yield products reproducibly have beendelineated. Techniques for sterilization of the final implant have been screened.}},

Although the goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset representing the complete sequence information for any given species, the database pragmatically includes sequence data that are currently publicly available in the archival databases. The database incorporates data from over 2400 organisms and includes over one million proteins representing significant taxonomic diversity spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses. Nucleotide and protein sequences are explicitly linked, and the sequences are linked to other resources including the NCBI Map Viewer and Gene. Sequences are annotated to include coding regions, conserved domains, variation, references, names, database cross-references, and other features using a combined approach of collaboration and other input from the scientific community, automated annotation, propagation from GenBank and curation by NCBI staff.}},
